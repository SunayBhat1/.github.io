									<h3 class="major">My Story</h3>
									<p>I was born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee... Go Vols! As a competative junior and collegiate tennis player, I played in national and international tournaments and was a proud member of the UT mens tennis team from 2013-2017. Tennis was an integral part of my early life and I believe the lessons and experiences that come from competative sports and team dynamic are incomparable. I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering, and I then spent three years working in defense at Lockheed Martin Santa Barbara Focalplane as a Test and then Systems Engineer. Since I have been in California, I became an avid surfer and also picked up hiking/backpacking, snowboarding, and all sorts of other activities that keeps me in the sun. I am always looking for the next interesting read in macroeconomics, behavioral science, and policy.</p>

									<p>I returned to graduate school fall of 2020 to join UCLA's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department as an MS/PhD student. I chose a Signals and Systems focus with research in AI applications in dynamic environments at the human machine interface. Now more than ever, it is clear the algorithms and decision-making software we deploy in the real-world cannot be the black boxes we prided in describing software as. The choices made from writing the first lines of code have downstream consequences that are incredible hard to predict. I believe a cross-disciplinary and "full-system" level approach is needed to better understand these consequences and design AI applications that add more value to the human expereince than they extract. Like many of the broader issues we face today, these are complex problems with complex solutions, and pretending otherwise limts our capacity to rise to the occasion.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Community and Causes</h3>
									<p>During my time at UT, I lost a close friend, and we lost a teammate, who battled a rare pediatric cancer while still competing for the team and inspiring all of us in the program and the tennis community at large. Today I have run, and plan to run at least a couple more marathons for The Sean Karl Foundation to remember Sean and help bring awareness and raise money for research into Ewings Sarcoma and other rare perdiactric cancers. See the link below to read more about the foundation and Mararthon Mike, Sean's tireless dad who continues to uplift with his feats or running and biking.</p>
